Ulla and Jürgen Kraus decided to develop stylish storage for the precious products. This was intended to create a new must-have for every modern bathroom.</p><h3>The idea of the b7 was born</h3><p>A slim design and three special climate zones require unique technology. After several years of development, the first cosmetics cooler for chic bathrooms was created. Since then, the daily beauty ritual has become a true joy.</p>",
        "description2": "<p>Today, the b7 is delivered to almost every country in the world. Sophisticated private customers, international architectural firms and renowned <strong>yacht builders and boat outfitters</strong> are among biszet's customers.</p><p><strong>Luxury hotels</strong> also quickly recognized that “the fridge” is an exclusive highlight for their demanding guests. As one of the first, the <strong>Jumeirah Emirates Towers</strong> in Dubai equipped the entire 40th floor as a “Ladies Floor” with the b7 from biszet. Many other hotels followed this avant-garde trend: Noble hotels such as the <strong>Cheval Blanc (LVMH)</strong> in Paris or the guest suite of <strong>DIOR</strong> on Avenue Montaigne pamper their discerning visitors with the amenity and special freshness of a biszet cosmetics climate cabinet.</p>",

If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p><h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3><p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO.

If these tools are enabled, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these countries. We would like you to note that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in third countries that are insecure in terms of data protection law.</p><p>We would like to point out that the US, as a secure third-party country, generally has a level of data protection comparable to that of the EU. Data transfer to the US is therefore permitted if the recipient is certified under the &ldquo;EU-US Data Privacy Framework&rdquo; (DPF) or has appropriate additional assurances. Information on transfers to third-party countries, including the data recipients, can be found in this Privacy Policy.</p><h3>Recipients of personal data</h3><p>In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data.

You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p><h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3><p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p><p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME.

IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p><h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3><p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p><h3>Right to data portability</h3><p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p><h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3><p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any time.

During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li><li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.</li><li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.</li><li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other.

      "content": "<p class='lead'>High-quality ingredients like vitamins and nanoparticles are more sensitive than you think. We spoke with pharmacist Dr. B. Stockebrand about why a single breath of air is enough to start bacterial growth, and why temperature fluctuations can destroy the effect of expensive creams.</p><h3>Why cooled storage?</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> After opening cosmetics, 'cooled storage' is often recommended. Why?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> High-quality cosmetic and care products are manufactured with great care. They contain highly purified ingredients, as germ-free as possible and free of allergens. However, as soon as a tube or jar is opened, a mere breath of air is enough to bring the first bacteria into contact with the ingredients. Further germs are introduced into the substances through use with fingers.<br/>Through oxygen in the air, but above all through temperature effects, these germs can multiply rapidly if the existing preservative system is overwhelmed. However, the trend is towards ever more sparing preservation to keep the burden on the skin as low as possible.</p><h3>Exponential Bacterial Growth</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> How quickly do these germs multiply?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> Microorganisms are known that multiply exponentially with a temperature jump of 10 °C. Storage at 20 °C may cause some bacteria to multiply 30 times faster than storage at only 10 °C.</p><h3>Loss of Effectiveness through Metabolism</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> What influence do bacteria and germs have on the effectiveness of cosmetics?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> Bacteria feed on valuable ingredients. This converts the active substances. New metabolic products are released, such as butyric acid. The content is completely changed. The desired effect is absent, and undesirable effects such as allergies can even occur.</p><h3>Vitamin A, C and E in Danger</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Which ingredients react particularly sensitively to heat?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> These are mainly vitamins A, C and E. These are contained as so-called antioxidants in many anti-wrinkle creams. They prevent oxidative decomposition processes in the subcutaneous tissue. Because oxidants destroy tissue, collagen fibers of the subcutis change and thus lead to wrinkle formation. This process is prevented by vitamins. However, these are heat-sensitive. The lower the temperature, 'the more comfortable they feel'.</p><h3>When the Cream Separates</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Significant temperature fluctuations often occur during storage. What do these cause in creams?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> Surely you have observed that creams separate into thick and thin components after some time. This is often the result of temperature fluctuations.</p><p><strong>biszet:</strong> What happens concretely?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> Temperature fluctuations trigger intense particle movement. Highly complicated systems collapse. The ingredients segregate and are no longer available in the desired composition.</p><h3>Decay of Nanoparticles</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Why can this make creams ineffective?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> High-quality ingredients are e.g. enveloped by lecithin and channeled as smallest particles (so-called nanoparticles) directly into the subcutaneous tissue of the skin to unfold their anti-aging effect there. All these systems are heat-sensitive, which can lead to these particles simply bursting and the active ingredients no longer reaching their destination in the subcutaneous tissue.</p><h3>Loss of Sun Protection Factor</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Cooled storage is also recommended to maintain the sun protection factor. Why?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> Many sun protection substances are simply incorporated by the bacteria mentioned. Storage between 20 and 25 °C results in a loss of effectiveness of 5 - 10 % per year. Through cooled storage, the effect is reduced by only a few percent.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Bathroom is an Imposition</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> So do you consider the use of a biszet cabinet to be sensible?</p><p><strong>Dr. B. Stockebrand:</strong> Yes, I consider storage in a biszet cabinet to be sensible, for all women who want to protect their creams. Because the bathroom is basically – due to its usually warm and humid climate – an imposition for cosmetics. In addition, I recommend removing creams not with fingers, but with a spatula.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Which temperature is specifically ideal for which skin type is explained by <a href='/en/knowledge/expert-interview-dr-kruppa' style='text-decoration:underline;'>Dermatologist Dr. Kruppa in this interview</a>.</p><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Thank you very much for the very informative interview.</p><p><strong>Dr. B.

      "content": "<p class='lead'>Many users put their creams in the kitchen fridge – but does that really make sense? We spoke with Cologne specialist Dr. Andreas Kruppa about germ dangers in open jars, the optimal temperature for Vitamin C and Retinol, and the physiological effect of cooled care on the skin.</p><h3>Design Furniture with Cooling: A Good Idea?</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Dr. Kruppa, we have developed an exclusive design piece of furniture specifically for the bathroom. It is very elegant and contains a special feature that has not existed in this form before. Cosmetics can be stored stylishly and cooled at the same time. What do you think of this idea?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> I think the idea is very good. Many women already keep their cosmetics in the kitchen fridge. That is very practical when you don't have to run from the bathroom to the kitchen and back.</p><h3>Why is Cooled Storage Important?</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Many cosmetics and skin care products bear the label 'please store in a cool place'. Why is cooled storage so important?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> After opening the jars, germs such as bacteria and fungi often get into the care products. These are in the air, but are increasingly introduced through use with fingers. This germ colonization can expand much faster at high temperatures than at cooler ones. This is comparable to milk that you forgot to put in the fridge. The germs can develop faster and the milk goes bad.</p><h3>Cooled Creams in Practice</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Do you also use cooled creams in your daily practice?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> Yes, for example after laser therapy, cooled creams with herbal ingredients are applied. These have a pleasantly soothing effect and are decongestant due to the coolness.</p><h3>The Optimal Temperature Range</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Which temperature range is optimal for storing cosmetics?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> Bacteria simply do not feel as comfortable in the cold as in the warmth. They prefer the warm and humid climate that arises especially with solar radiation when condensation settles in the jars. But even at 20 °C, germs multiply significantly faster than at 10 °C. But it shouldn't be too cold either, otherwise the content crystallizes. Therefore, one should better take cosmetics into carry-on luggage on flights, as they are often exposed to temperatures of up to minus 40 °C in the luggage compartment.<br/>I therefore generally recommend storage at approx. 10 °C, collagen-containing products should rather be stored at approx. 12 °C. Vitamin-containing products, on the other hand, prefer storage at 5 to 8 °C.</p><h3>Influence on Effectiveness</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> What influence does cooled storage have on the effectiveness of cosmetics?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> Well, first of all, the use of cooled creams and lotions is significantly more pleasant than using uncooled products. Subjectively, a tightening sensation is triggered. This is because the blood vessels initially contract due to the coolness and blood circulation is increased. Then the vessels dilate again and the active ingredients can be absorbed much faster and better.</p><h3>Heat-Sensitive Ingredients</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Some cosmetics manufacturers even recommend in their leaflets that the 'cream should not be warmed in the hands so that full effectiveness is maintained'. Which ingredients react so sensitively?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> That can be completely different ingredients. Many anti-wrinkle creams contain Vitamin C, for example. This oxidizes very quickly and thus loses its effect. Like many other chemical reactions, this process is accelerated by heat supply. <br/><em>(How fast these chemical processes occur is detailed by <a href='/en/knowledge/expert-interview-dr-stockebrand' style='text-decoration:underline;'>Pharmacist Dr. Stockebrand here</a>).</em></p><h3>Products without Preservatives</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Many men and women already use care products without preservatives. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such products?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> Many patients develop so-called contact allergies to preservatives such as parabens. Eczema develops on the skin, which can be very unpleasant for those affected. Creams without preservatives can spoil faster, however, as germ colonization can occur more easily.</p><h3>Dangers of Spoiled Cosmetics</h3><p><strong>biszet:</strong> What can a spoiled cream cause on the skin?</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> In addition to the lack of effectiveness, different skin irritations such as redness, burning and dandruff can occur. You recognize spoiled creams by the fact that they change their smell (they stink), but also their consistency. Often the content separates into thick and thin. These are signs that unwanted chemical reactions have taken place here, which can have a completely different effect on the skin than originally desired.</p><p><strong>biszet:</strong> Dr. Kruppa, thank you very much for the friendly and informative interview.</p><p><strong>Dr. A. Kruppa:</strong> You are welcome.</p>"

[cite_start]Our answer in the video is clear: It is about the <strong>three specialized climate zones</strong> that a normal fridge cannot offer [cite: 4][cite_start]:</p><ul><li><strong>The Vitamin Zone (4–6°C):</strong> At the bottom, we store vitamin-containing products that are extremely heat-sensitive [cite: 7][cite_start].</li><li><strong>The Preservative-Free Zone (9–10°C):</strong> The middle is perfect for natural cosmetics to inhibit bacterial growth without harsh chemicals [cite: 8][cite_start].</li><li><strong>The Collagen Zone (12°C):</strong> At the top, there is space for products that would lose their consistency if it were too cold [cite: 9][cite_start].</li></ul><p>RTL summarizes: Anyone who wants to follow the recommendations of <a href='/en/knowledge/expert-interview-dr-stockebrand' style='text-decoration:underline;'>pharmacists</a> and <a href='/en/knowledge/expert-interview-dr-kruppa' style='text-decoration:underline;'>dermatologists</a> needs this precise cooling[cite: 7]. <em>(Why bacteria explode at 20 degrees is explained <a href='/en/knowledge/expert-interview-dr-stockebrand' style='text-decoration:underline;'>in detail by Dr. Stockebrand here</a>).</em></p><h3>When 'The Material Girl' Calls</h3><p>Discretion is our top priority, which is why we rarely speak about our customers. But we gave the RTL team a small glimpse into our order books. [cite_start]Of course, no world star calls personally – that happens through managers and architects [cite: 36][cite_start].</p><p>But the hints are often clear: When an architect orders a device for 'The Material Girl', we know it involves Madonna[cite: 38]. [cite_start]Inquiries for a 'Princess from the Orient' or projects for mega-yachts are also part of our business [cite: 39, 40][cite_start].</p><p>An anecdote Jürgen tells in the report shows the dimensions: An oligarch wanted a 1.80-meter high custom-made product for his yacht[cite: 45]. [cite_start]When we noted that this was uneconomical, he just smiled: After all, there were also snow rooms on the yacht for cooling down – money played no role [cite: 48][cite_start].</p><h3>Our Conclusion</h3><p>Whether at the <strong>Cheval Blanc in Paris</strong>, the <strong>Ritz-Carlton Berlin</strong>, or in your home[cite: 51]: The RTL report confirms that the biszet b7 is far more than a luxury object. [cite_start]It is a 'tabernacle of beauty' that combines effectiveness and design[cite: 3].</p><p><strong>Watch the full report here:</strong></p><p><a href='https://www.rtl.de/video/eiskalter-trend-oder-voelliger-quatsch-65e04728088c9cee220ddd7b.html' target='_blank' class='btn btn-primary'>Watch Video on RTL.de</a></p>"

      {
        "question": "Why should cosmetics be cooled?",
        "answer": "Heat and humidity in the bathroom accelerate the decay of your products. Cooling protects sensitive active ingredients such as <strong>Vitamin C and Retinol</strong> from oxidation and loss of effectiveness. [cite_start]In addition, the cold massively inhibits bacterial growth in opened jars – particularly important for natural cosmetics[cite: 6, 7]. Another benefit: The cold stimulus has an immediate de-puffing effect when applied."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which is the best cosmetics fridge?",
        "answer": "<p>That depends on your requirements for hygiene and shelf life. Experts define the 'best' standard by three factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel is more hygienic than plastic.</li><li><strong>Technology:</strong> It must prevent condensation inside.</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> It must offer different climate zones (4–12°C), as vitamins require different temperatures than collagen.</li></ul>The <strong>biszet b7</strong> is the only device worldwide developed to combine exactly these professional criteria in one design object."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why isn't a normal fridge sufficient for cosmetics?",
        "answer": "A household refrigerator in the kitchen is designed for food – usually 4 to 7 degrees. This is too cold for high-quality creams. Oils can flocculate, emulsions lose their stability. The <strong>biszet b7</strong> operates in a gentle spectrum (approx. 4–12 °C) across 3 levels, which is exactly matched to the structure of skincare products. Additionally, this prevents expensive serums from taking on the smell of food.<br/><a href=\"/en/knowledge/expert-interview-dr-kruppa\">Read the interview with Dr. Kruppa.</a>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Which products benefit from cooling?",
        "answer": "Especially <strong>organic natural cosmetics</strong> (without preservatives) and products with unstable active ingredients like <strong>Vitamin C and Retinol</strong>. Cooling extends shelf life, prevents oxidation and enhances the decongestant effect (De-Puffing) upon application."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can the biszet be placed in the bathroom?",
        "answer": "Yes, that was the basic requirement of the development. The biszet b7 consists of powder-coated <strong>stainless steel</strong>. Neither high humidity nor splash water in the spa area can harm it. It functions both as an elegant solitaire and built into bathroom furniture."
      },
      {
        "question": "How loud is the cosmetics refrigerator?",
        "answer": "The b7 is designed for quiet zones such as bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms. It operates extremely quietly. There is no loud compressor humming to disturb your sleep – a decisive difference to conventional mini-bars or camping fridges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Cosmetics fridge or mini-fridge – what is better?",
        "answer": "Here we compare a technical piece of furniture with simple camping equipment. Cheap mini-fridges often cool uncontrolled (danger of condensation) or use simple fans. The biszet actively controls <strong>three temperature zones</strong> and ensures a dry microclimate. It is a long-term investment in the quality of your skincare and a design object."
